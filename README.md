# Head-First-Android-Development
Exercises from book Head First Android Development. 

This is my implementation of all simple apps from http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029045.do. 
This is great book to get you started with Android develompment. I recomend it greatly.

CoffeinaWithDb is not implemented - this exercise was too boring.
